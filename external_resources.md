## Data Warehouses and Data Marts
Data marts and data warehouses add another level of abstraction to your data structure. They are typically employed when a database management system contains a massive amount of data with different data types and when different groups of people need to view different segments of the data. Data marts and warehouses are usually associated with SQL-structured databases. While it is unlikely that lab-sized databases will require data warehouses and data marts, the following resources are provided in case these structure tools are relevant.

## Database Views
Like data warehouses and data marts, databse views are the most useful for large datasets where different groups of people need access to different segments of the data. Database views are also generally associated with SQL-structured databases. However, the following tutorial links are provided in case database views are relevant.
